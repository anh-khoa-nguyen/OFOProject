OFO is a full-stack web application that simulates a complete online food ordering and delivery platform. The project is designed with a robust architecture to serve three primary user roles: **Customers**, **Restaurant Owners**, and **Administrators**. It integrates modern technologies and features a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for testing and deployment.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### Prerequisites
-   Python 3.11+
-   Node.js and npm (for installing Cypress and other frontend dependencies)
-   A running MySQL or MariaDB server

### Local Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anh-khoa-nguyen/OFOProject.git
    cd OFOProject/OFO
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Update the database connection string in `config.py` (`DevelopmentConfig` class) with your MySQL credentials:
    ```python
    # D:\OFOProject\OFO\config.py
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = "mysql+pymysql://YOUR_USER:%s@localhost/ofodb?charset=utf8mb4" % quote('YOUR_PASSWORD')
    ```
    You also need to set up API keys for MoMo, Google, and Cloudinary in the same file.

5.  **Create and Seed the Database:**
    Run the `create_db.py` script to set up the database schema and populate it with sample data.
    ```bash
    python create_db.py
    ```

6.  **Run the Flask Application:**
    The application uses Socket.IO, so run it via `run.py`.
    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## üß™ Running Tests

The project includes a comprehensive test suite.

### Unit & Integration Tests
Ensure your Flask environment is configured for testing and run the `unittest` discover command from the `OFO` directory.
```bash
# From the D:\OFOProject\OFO directory
set FLASK_CONFIG=testing
python -m unittest discover```

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests with Cypress
1.  **Install Cypress:**
    ```bash
    # From the D:\OFOProject\OFO directory
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the tests:**
    Make sure the Flask application is running. Then, open the Cypress Test Runner:
    ```bash
    npx cypress open
    ```
    Select the desired spec file to run the tests.

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)

This project is configured with a `Jenkinsfile` for a complete Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipeline, which automates the following stages:

1.  **Update Code:** Pulls the latest changes from the specified Git branch.
2.  **Setup Environment:** Installs all necessary Python and Node.js dependencies.
3.  **Run Unit Tests:** Executes the Python unit test suite and generates a coverage report.
4.  **Run E2E Tests:** Starts the Flask server in the background and runs the full Cypress E2E test suite.
5.  **Build & Push Docker Image:** If changes are detected in the source code or Docker configuration, it builds a new Docker image, tags it with the build number and `latest`, and pushes it to Docker Hub.
6.  **Trigger Railway Redeploy:** Automatically triggers a new deployment on the Railway hosting platform using the latest Docker image.
